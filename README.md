# Hi there 👋, I'm Deepakumar M

🚀 **Network Engineer | Wireshark, Python, Linux | Bridging the Gap between Hardware and Virtualization**

Currently, I am revolutionizing internal AP testing processes by building an automated pipeline. By transforming test requirements into executable Python scripts, I have optimized configuration workflows and enabled automated validation using pcap analysis.

My background is a unique blend of core electronics and modern application development. Whether I’m designing a cross-platform mobile app in Flutter, building backends with Flask, or configuring complex LAN environments, I focus on one thing: making systems smarter and more efficient.
